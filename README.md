This repo uses `@graphql-codegen/cli` with two schemas, however though, using these two schemas results in a validation error that I'm not sure how to resolve. This is where the `skipDocumentsValidation` flag comes in to play, but doing so results in the bug described in my issue.

## Steps to reproduce

1. `yarn install`

2. `yarn start`
